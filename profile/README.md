At [OpenLocus Labs](https://openlocus.ai/), we're advancing AI and its applications. Here's a snapshot of our work:

- **Data-Driven Discovery**: [derive new insights, generate & verify hypotheses from observational data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13610). 

- **Data-Driven Discovery**: setting research direction (ICML 24), creating benchmarks, and agents to accelerate science.
- **Reliable LLMs at Petabyte Scale**: improving analytics & reporting with LLMs for various public companies.
- **Constrained Code Generation**: code & agent orchestration at scale for increasing efficiency & business outcomes.
- **Forecasting with Alternate Data:** unconventional data sources & data-centric ML for Fortune 500.
- **LLM Powered Web Extensions**: inspired by [Andrej Karpathy](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1715806187663585287) to improve focus, filter noise, and find what matters.

Our previous ML work has been used to [benchmark reasoning in LLMs](https://blog.research.google/2022/05/language-models-perform-reasoning-via.html) and has been [endorsed by AI leaders](https://www.practicalnlp.ai/#testimonials) from Microsoft & Google.
