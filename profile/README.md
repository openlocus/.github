OpenLocus is working on open source to improve focus, filter noise, and find what matters.

Are you dealing with information overload and filter bubbles? Do you feel there is diminishing control over the information you get? Are you finding it harder to discover relevant knowledge on the web? 

We are working to address this - follow us to know more!
